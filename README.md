## Project summary

This repository contains the analysis and deliverables produced for the **Chips Category Review** prepared for Julia (Category Manager). The work answers two core questions:

- **Who buys chips and how do they shop?** â€” segment-level behaviour, pack-size and price-point preferences.  
- **Did the new layout trial work?** â€” evaluation of trial stores **77, 86 and 88** against matched control stores; uplift analysis and driver diagnostics.

Deliverables include reproducible Jupyter notebooks, cleaned data exports, visual assets and a client-ready presentation.

## Key findings â€” executive highlights

- **Primary customer contributors:** *Older Families (Budget)* and *Young Singles/Couples (Mainstream)* are the dominant drivers of chips volume and sales.
- **Pack-size behaviour:** Singles/Couples tend to purchase larger pack sizes (~185g). Families purchase more units per transaction (higher quantity).
- **Price preference:** Budget and Mainstream tiers account for the majority of sales; Premium appeals mainly to older singles and retirees.
- **Trial evaluation summary (Febâ€“Apr 2019):**
  - **Store 77**: ~**+5.2% uplift** in sales compared to its matched control; uplift primarily driven by **increased transactions** rather than increased customer reach.
  - **Stores 86 & 88**: No statistically meaningful uplift vs matched controls.
- **Primary implication:** A targeted rollout is recommended â€” expand the new layout to stores whose customer and sales profile closely match Store 77; defer or re-test in stores resembling 86 and 88.

## Strategic recommendations (summary)

1. **Rollout strategy**
   - Pilot rollout to a cohort of stores matched to Store 77 (demographic mix, life-stage distribution, affluence).
   - Ensure matched-control measurement and at least two quarters of post-rollout monitoring before broader rollout.

2. **Merchandising & pack strategy**
   - Introduce family-value bundles and multi-save packs targeted at Older & Young Families.
   - Offer premium, single-serve or large-pack lines positioned for Singles/Couples and Retirees.

3. **Marketing & personalization**
   - Leverage loyalty and life-stage signals to target promotions and communications.
   - Run A/B tests for promotional placement, pack sizes and pricing across matched stores.

4. **Analytics & measurement**
   - Continue matched-control experiments for any future layout changes.
   - Track both reach (unique customers) and intensity (transactions per customer) to surface the driver of any sales change.

## Visuals & deliverables

Place or generate the following assets in `outputs/`:

- `trial_analysis_plots.pdf` â€” trial vs control visualisations and diagnostics  
- `total_sales_by_segment.png` â€” sales by `LIFESTAGE Ã— PREMIUM_CUSTOMER`  
- `average_pack_size_by_segment.png` â€” pack-size behaviour by segment  
- `Chips_Final_Report_Presentation.pptx` â€” client-ready presentation (if available)  
- `Chips_Category_Strategic_Report.docx` â€” formatted written report (if available)

_Note:_ keep visual style consistent across slides (colours, fonts, series ordering) for client-facing deliverables.

## Appendix â€” Useful code snippets

### Convert Excel serial date to `datetime`
```python
import pandas as pd
df['DATE'] = pd.to_datetime(df['DATE'], origin='1899-12-30', unit='D')
````

### Extract pack size (grams) from product name

```python
df['PACK_SIZE'] = df['PROD_NAME'].str.extract(r'(\d+)\s?g', expand=False).astype(float)
```

### Compute monthly store metrics

```python
df['MONTH'] = df['DATE'].dt.to_period('M')
monthly_metrics = df.groupby(['STORE_NBR','MONTH']).agg(
    total_sales=('TOT_SALES','sum'),
    unique_customers=('LYLTY_CARD_NBR','nunique'),
    transactions=('TXN_ID','nunique')
).reset_index()
monthly_metrics['avg_txn_per_customer'] = monthly_metrics['transactions'] / monthly_metrics['unique_customers']
```

### Match control store by Pearson correlation (example)

```python
from scipy.stats import pearsonr

def match_control(trial_series, candidate_series):
    aligned = pd.concat([trial_series, candidate_series], axis=1).dropna()
    if len(aligned) < 6:
        return None
    corr, _ = pearsonr(aligned.iloc[:,0], aligned.iloc[:,1])
    return corr
```
